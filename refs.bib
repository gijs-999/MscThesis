  abstract = {This paper describes a general passivity-based framework for the control of flexible joint robots. Recent results on torque, position, as well as impedance control of flexible joint robots are summarized, and the relations between the individual contributions are highlighted. It is shown that an inner torque feedback loop can be incorporated into a passivity-based analysis by interpreting torque feedback in terms of shaping of the motor inertia. This result, which implicitly was already included in earlier work on torque and position control, can also be used for the design of impedance controllers. For impedance control, furthermore, potential energy shaping is of special interest. It is shown how, based only on the motor angles, a potential function can be designed which simultaneously incorporates gravity compensation and a desired Cartesian stiffness relation for the link angles. All the presented controllers were experimentally evaluated on DLR lightweight robots and their performance and robustness shown with respect to uncertain model parameters. Experimental results with position controllers as well as an impact experiment are presented briefly, and an overview of several applications is given in which the controllers have been applied.},

  abstract = {The main contribution is proposing a methodology that allows for a meaningful quantitative comparison between the recorded post-impact data, that exhibits a damped oscillatory response after the impact, and the post- impact velocity prediction derived via the readily available rigid-body robot model, that presents no oscillations. Accurate post-impact velocity predictions are essential in developing impact-aware manipulation strategies for robots, where contacts are intentionally established at non-zero speed mimicking human manipulation abilities in dynamic grasping and pushing of objects. Starting from the recorded dynamic response of a 7DOF torque-controlled robot that intentionally impacts a rigid surface, we investigate the possibility and accuracy of predicting the post-impact robot velocity from the pre-impact velocity and impact configuration. The velocity prediction is obtained by means of an impact map, derived using the framework of nonsmooth mechanics, that makes use of the known rigid-body robot model and the assumption of a frictionless inelastic impact.The main contribution is proposing a methodology that allows for a meaningful quantitative comparison between the recorded post-impact data, that exhibits a damped oscillatory response after the impact, and the post-impact velocity prediction derived via the readily available rigid-body robot model, that presents no oscillations and that is the one typically obtained via mainstream robot simulator software. The results of this new approach are promising in terms of prediction accuracy and thus relevant for the growing field of impact-aware robot control. The recorded impact data (18 experiments) is made publicly available, together with the numerical routines employed to generate the quantitative comparison, to further stimulate interest/research in this field.},

  abstract = {The stiffness properties of industrial robots are very important for many industrial applications, such as automatic robotic assembly and material removal processes (e.g., machining and deburring). On the one hand, in robotic assembly, joint compliance can be useful for compensating dimensional errors in the parts to be assembled; on the other hand, in material removal processes, a high Cartesian stiffness of the end-effector is required. Moreover, low frequency chatter vibrations can be induced when low-stiffness robots are used, with an impairment in the quality of the machined surface. In this paper, a compliant joint dynamic model of an industrial robot has been developed, in which joint stiffness has been experimentally identified using a modal approach. First, a novel method to select the test configurations has been developed, so that in each configuration the mode of vibration that chiefly involves only one joint is excited. Then, experimental tests are carried out in the selected configurations in order to identify joint stiffness. Finally, the developed dynamic model of the robot is used to predict the variation of the natural frequencies in the workspace.},

In contrast to the simple planar rubber pad foot sole that is conventionally used in humanoid robots this paper introduces a new foot sole design in which the dissipation of energy during collision is done effectively using a viscous air damping sole mechanism that provides better reduction of the ground impact forces. The paper describes the principle of the foot sole and provides details of its design and implementation. Experimental trials were performed with the child size humanoid robot, COMAN, wearing the proposed feet to validate their performance during landing and walking. The results demonstrate that the proposed new passive damping mechanism can reduce effectively the ground reaction impact forces and oscillations while maintaining the foot/body posture.},

  abstract = {When legged robots walk on rugged roads, they would suffer from strong impact from the ground. The impact would cause the legged robots to vibrate, which would affect their normal operation. Therefore, it is necessary to take measures to absorb impact energy and reduce vibration. As an important part of a goat’s foot, the hoof capsule can effectively buffer the impact from the ground in the goat’s running and jumping. The structure of the hoof capsules and its principle of buffering and vibration reduction were studied. Inspired by the unique shape and internal structure of the hoof capsules, a bionic foot was designed. Experimental results displayed that the bionic foot could effectively use friction to consume impact energy and ensured the stability of legged robot walking. In addition, the bionic foot had a lower natural vibration frequency, which was beneficial to a wide range of vibration reduction. This work brings a new solution to the legged robot to deal with the ground impact, which helps it adapt to a variety of complex terrain.},

This work presents an extension of balance control for torque-controlled humanoid robots. Within a non-strict task hierarchy, the controller allows the robot to use the feet end-effectors to balance, while the remaining hand end-effectors can be used to perform Dual-Arm manipulation. The controller generates a passive and compliance behaviour to regulate the location of the centre of mass (CoM), the orientation of the hip and the poses of each end-effector assigned to the task of interaction (in this case bi-manipulation). Then, an appropriate wrench (force and torque) is applied to each of the end-effectors employed for the task to achieve this purpose. Now, in this new controller, the essential requirement focuses on the fact that the desired wrench in the CoM is computed through the sum of the balancing and bi-manipulation wrenches. The bi-manipulation wrenches are obtained through a new dynamic model that allows executing tasks of approaching the grip and manipulation of large objects compliantly. On the other hand, the feedback controller has been maintained but in combination with a bi-manipulation-oriented feedforward control to improve the performance in the object trajectory tracking. This controller is tested in different experiments with the robot TORO.},

  abstract = {We propose a method to generate actuation plans for a reduced order, dynamic model of bipedal running. This method explicitly enforces robustness to ground uncertainty. The plan generated is not a fixed body trajectory that is aggressively stabilized: instead, the plan interacts with the passive dynamics of the reduced order model to create emergent robustness. The goal is to create plans for legged robots that will be robust to imperfect perception of the environment, and to work with dynamics that are too complex to optimize in real-time. Working within this dynamic model of legged locomotion, we optimize a set of disturbance cases together with the nominal case, all with linked inputs. The input linking is nontrivial due to the hybrid dynamics of the running model but our solution is effective and has analytical gradients. The optimization procedure proposed is significantly slower than a standard trajectory optimization, but results in robust gaits that reject disturbances extremely effectively without any replanning required.},

According to the role that each leg plays, the control system is decomposed into two parts: the swing leg control and the support leg control. The trajectory of the swing foot is generated in realtime to regulate the walking speed. By considering the reaction torque of the swing leg’s hip joint as disturbance, a sliding model controller is implemented at the support leg’s hip joint to control the torso’s posture angle. In order to make sure the landing foot does not rebound after impact, the vertical contact force control is set as the internal loop of the hip’s height control. In simulation, the control system is tested on a virtual 5-link planar biped walker in Matlab. Finally, stable biped walking is realized on uneven terrain with roughness up to 2cm.},

  abstract = {Since torque in harmonic drives is transmitted by a pure couple, harmonic drives do not generate radial forces and therefore can be instrumented with torque sensors without interference from radial forces. The installation of torque sensors on the stationary component of harmonic drives (the Flexipline cup in this research work) produce backdrivability needed for robotic and telerobotic compliant maneuvers [3, 4, 6]. Backdrivability of a harmonic drive, when used as torque increaser, means that the output shaft can be rotated via finite amount of torque. A high ratio harmonic drive is non-backdrivable because its output shaft cannot be turned by applying a torque on it. This article first develops the dynamic behavior of a harmonic drive, in particular the non-backdrivability, in terms of a sensitivity transfer function. The instrumentation of the harmonic drive with torque sensor is then described. This leads to a description of the control architecture which allows modulation of the sensitivity transfer function within the limits established by the closed-loop stability. A set of experiments on an active hand controller, powered by a DC motor coupled to an instrumented harmonic drive, is given to exhibit this method’s limitations.},

First, the mechanical design of the flexible foot is proposed. Rubber bushes and rubber pads are adopted for absorbing impacts. Then, the implementation of hardware and software for the foot attitude estimation system is presented. MEMS accelerometer and angular rate gyroscopes operate as dynamic inclination measurement sensors and a DSP is used for signal collecting and processing. Finally, the effectiveness of the developed flexible foot is confirmed by several experiments.},

  abstract = {In the context of robotics and automation, learning from demonstration (LfD) is the paradigm in which robots acquire new skills by learning to imitate an expert. The choice of LfD over other robot learning methods is compelling when ideal behavior can be neither easily scripted (as is done in traditional robot programming) nor easily defined as an optimization problem, but can be demonstrated. While there have been multiple surveys of this field in the past, there is a need for a new one given the considerable growth in the number of publications in recent years. This review aims to provide an overview of the collection of machine-learning methods used to enable a robot to learn from and imitate a teacher. We focus on recent advancements in the field and present an updated taxonomy and characterization of existing methods. We also discuss mature and emerging application areas for LfD and highlight the significant challenges that remain to be overcome both in theory and in practice.},

In this paper, a novel biomimetic object impedance control strategy (BOI) is presented for dual-arm cooperative 7-DOF humanoid manipulators. A general impedance architecture comprising internal impedance control and object impedance control is adopted, which aims at conferring impedance behavior both in end-effector level and object level. Asymptotic stability and convergence of this controller are strictly derived from Lyapunov stability theory. Compared with conventional object impedance, the proposed controller can show different object impedance characteristics according to the external force applied on the object. It also can simultaneously minimize the energy cost of the adaptation process. Simulation and experimental results indicate that this controller exhibits explicit compliance behavior when the interaction with environment is weak and presents accumulation property of the stiffness and damping accordingly when the interaction is strong. This human-like characteristic enables the object/dual-arm system to deal with complex and unknown environmental disturbances.},

Nearby solutions jump at close but noncoincident times, making the standard notion of closeness, based on vector difference, unsuitable to compare trajectories point-wise in time. With tracking control as ultimate goal, we propose a notion of stability and a constructive stability proof based on sensitivity analysis applicable to single-jump-flow trajectories. A key role in the analysis is played by a time-triggered linear system, associated with the discontinuous trajectory of interest, whose uniform asymptotic stability suffices to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the original discontinuous trajectory. As an illustrative example, the stability analysis is applied to guarantee closed-loop stable tracking for a trajectory with velocity jumps of a 2 DoF mechanical system with unilateral constraint.},

The basic assumption that enables this type of analysis is that jumps are triggered when the state reaches, transversally, a sufficiently smooth switching surface. In many scenarios of practical relevance, however, this switching surface is just piecewise smooth and, moreover, a perturbation of the initial conditions or the input leads to a different number of jumps than the nominal trajectory's. This work extends the sensitivity analysis in this context, under the assumptions that (i) at least locally, the intermediate perturbation-dependent jumps lead the system to reach always the nominal post-impact mode and (ii) once a switching and corresponding intermediate jump has occurred, its corresponding constraint remains active until reaching the nominal post-impact mode. Numerical simulations complement and validate the theoretical findings.},

This results in peak forces and high frequency vibrations that resonate through the system, damage components, and complicate control algorithms. Prior research considers how damping material, such as rubber, mitigates these effects. However, this paper shows the benefits of spring protection where both stiffness and maximum compression are customized to the leg. The spring mitigates the impact force peak by gradually bringing the leg's inertia to rest. The maximum compression point (i.e. a hard stop) then provides a rigid surface that is ideal for stance. We provide a foot design methodology, validated through simulation and physical testing, that first considers springs in isolation, then in tandem with damping. We show that the coupling of springs and dampers reduces rigid body collisions and foot vibrations in a way that traditional methods, reliant on damping – have yet to achieve.},

We consider state-triggered discontinuities in the state evolution, potentially accompanied by mode switching in the control vector field. For a given trajectory with state jumps, we show how to construct an approximation of the nearby perturbed trajectory corresponding to a given variation of the initial condition and input signal. A major complication in the construction of such an approximation is that, in general, the jump times corresponding to a nearby perturbed trajectory are not equal to those of the nominal one. The main contribution of this work is the development of a notion of error to clarify in which sense the approximate trajectory is, at each instant of time, a first-order approximation of the perturbed trajectory. This notion of error naturally finds application in the (local) tracking problem of a time-varying reference trajectory of a hybrid system. To illustrate the possible use of this new error definition in the context of trajectory tracking, we outline how the standard linear trajectory tracking control for nonlinear systems could be generalized for hybrid systems.},

Ensuring a smooth transition from free motion to contact is crucial as incurring a large impact force may lead to unstable contact with the robot bouncing on the surface, i.e., chattering. Stabilizing the forces at contact is not possible as the impact lasts for less than a millisecond, leaving no time for the robot to react to the impact force. We present a strategy in which the robot adapts its dynamic before entering into contact. The speed is modulated so as to align with the surface. We leverage the properties of autonomous dynamical systems for immediate replanning and handling unforeseen perturbations and exploit local modulations of the dynamics to control for the smooth transitions at contact. We show theoretically and empirically that by using the modulation framework, the robot can stably touch the contact surface, even when the surface's location is uncertain, at a desired location, and finally, leave the surface or stop on the surface at a desired point.},

  abstract = {One of the fundamental requirements for the success of a robot task is the capability to handle interaction between manipulator and environment. The quantity that describes the state of interaction more effectively is the contact force at the manipulator's end effector. High values of contact force are generally undesirable since they may stress both the manipulator and the manipulated object; hence the need to seek for effective force control strategies. The book provides a theoretical and experimental treatment of robot interaction control. In the framework of model-based operational space control, stiffness control and impedance control are presented as the basic strategies for indirect force control; a key feature is the coverage of six-degree-of-freedom interaction tasks and manipulator kinematic redundancy. Then, direct force control strategies are presented which are obtained from motion control schemes suitably modified by the closure of an outer force regulation feedback loop. Finally, advanced force and position control strategies are presented which include passivity-based, adaptive and output feedback control schemes. Remarkably, all control schemes are experimentally tested on a setup consisting of a seven-joint industrial robot with open control architecture and force/torque sensor. The topic of robot force control is not treated in depth in robotics textbooks, in spite of its crucial importance for practical manipulation tasks. In the few books addressing this topic, the material is often limited to single-degree-of-freedom tasks. On the other hand, several results are available in the robotics literature but no dedicated monograph exists. The book is thus aimed at filling this gap by providing a theoretical and experimental treatment of robot force control.},

  abstract = {In robotics, the risk of collisions is present both in industrial applications and in remote handling. If a collision occurs, the impact may damage both the robot and external equipment, which may result in successive imprecise robot tasks or line stops, reducing robot efficiency. As a result, appropriate collision avoidance algorithms should be used or, if it is not possible, the robot must be able to react to impacts reducing the contact forces. For this purpose, this paper focuses on the development of a special end-effector that can withstand impacts. It is able to protect the robot from impulsive forces caused by collisions of the end-effector, but it has no effect on possible collisions between the links and obstacles. The novel end-effector is based on a bi-stable mechanism that decouples the dynamics of the end-effector from the dynamics of the robot. The intrinsically nonlinear behavior of the end-effector is investigated with the aid of numerical simulations. The effect of design parameters and operating conditions are analyzed and the interaction between the functioning of the bi-stable mechanism and the control system is studied. In particular, the effect of the mechanism in different scenarios characterized by different robot velocities is shown. Results of numerical simulations assess the validity of the proposed end-effector, which can lead to large reductions in impact forces. Numerical results are validated by means of specific laboratory tests.},

  abstract = {This document provides a revision of the notation originally introduced in [20] for describing kinematics and dynamics quantities of mechanical systems composed by several rigid bodies. Relative to the first edition, this new version includes an expanded section on frame acceleration (Section 5.4), the correction of a few typos, and the change of the fonts used in the notation from single face to bold face.The notation detailed in this document is inspired by the well-known Featherstone notation introduced in [7], also used, with small adaptations, in the Handbook of Robotics [16]. Featherstone’s notation, while being extremely compact and pleasant for the eye, is not fully in accordance with Lie group formalism, with the potential of creating a misunderstanding between the robotics and geometric mechanics communities.The Lie group formalism is well established in the robotics literature [13, 14,10]. However, it is less compact than Featherstone’s notation [7], leading to long expressions when several rigid bodies are present as in the case of a complete dynamic model of humanoid or quadruped robots. This report aims, therefore, at getting the best from these two worlds. The notation strives to be compact, precise, and in harmony with Lie Group formalism. The document furthermore introduces a flexible and unambiguous notationto describe the Jacobians mapping generalized velocities of an arbitrary frame to Cartesian linear and angular velocities, expressed with respect to a reference frame of choice.},

  abstract = {With the aim of further enabling the exploitation of impacts in robotic manipulation, a control framework is presented that directly tackles the challenges posed by tracking control of robotic manipulators that are tasked to perform nominally simultaneous impacts associated to multiple contact points. To this end, we extend the framework of reference spreading, which uses an extended ante- and post-impact reference coherent with a rigid impact map, determined under the assumption of an inelastic simultaneous impact. In practice, the robot will not reside exactly on the reference at the impact moment; as a result a sequence of impacts at the different contact points will typically occur. Our new approach extends reference spreading in this context via the introduction of an additional intermediate control mode. In this mode, a torque command is still based on the ante-impact reference with the goal of reaching the target contact state, but velocity feedback is disabled as this can be potentially harmful due to rapid velocity changes. With an eye towards real implementation, the approach is formulated using a QP control framework and is validated using numerical simulations both on a rigid robot model and on a realistic robot model with flexible joints.},

  abstract = {Generating on-purpose impacts with rigid robots is challenging as they may lead to severe hardware failures due to abrupt changes in the velocities and torques. Without dedicated hardware and controllers, robots typically operate at a near-zero velocity in the vicinity of contacts. We assume knowing how much of impact the hardware can absorb and focus solely on the controller aspects. The novelty of our approach is twofold: (i) it uses the task-space inverse dynamics formalism that we extend by seamlessly integrating impact tasks; (ii) it does not require separate models with switches or a reset map to operate the robot undergoing impact tasks. Our main idea lies in integrating post-impact states prediction and impact-aware inequality constraints as part of our existing general-purpose whole-body controller. To achieve such prediction, we formulate task-space impacts and its spreading along the kinematic tree of a floating-base robot with subsequent joint velocity and torque jumps. As a result, the feasible solution set accounts for various constraints due to expected impacts. In a multi-contact situation of under-actuated legged robots subject to multiple impacts, we also enforce standing stability margins. By design, our controller does not require precise knowledge of impact location and timing. We assessed our formalism with the humanoid robot HRP-4, generating maximum contact velocities, neither breaking established contacts nor damaging the hardware.},

  abstract = {This thesis introduces a new measure of balance for bipedal robotics called the foot placement estimator (FPE). To develop this measure, stability first is defined for a simple biped.  A proof of the stability of a simple biped in a controls sense is shown to exist using classical methods for nonlinear systems. With the addition of a contact model, an analytical solution is provided to define the bounds of the region of stability.  This provides the basis for the FPE which estimates where the biped must step in order to be stable. By using the FPE in combination with a state machine, complete  gait cycles are created without any precalculated trajectories. This includes gait initiation and termination. The bipedal model is then advanced to include more realistic mechanical and environmental models and the FPE approach is verified in a dynamic simulation.  From these results, a 5-link, point-foot robot is designed and constructed to provide the final validation that the FPE can be used to provide closed-loop gait control.  In addition, this approach is shown to demonstrate significant robustness to external disturbances. Finally, the FPE is shown in experimental results to be an unprecedented estimate of  where humans place their feet for walking and jumping, and for stepping in response to an external disturbance.},

  abstract = {Purpose               The purpose of this paper is to present a mask‐image‐projection‐based stereolithography (MIP‐SL) process that can combine two base materials with various concentrations and structures to produce a solid object with desired material characteristics. Stereolithography is an additive manufacturing process in which liquid photopolymer resin is cross‐linked and converted to solid. The fabrication of digital material requires frequent resin changes during the building process. The process presented in this paper attempts to address the related challenges in achieving such fabrication capability.                                         Design/methodology/approach               A two‐channel system design is presented for the multi‐material MIP‐SL process. In such a design, a coated thick film and linear motions in two axes are used to reduce the separation force of a cured layer. The material cleaning approach to thoroughly remove resin residue on built surfaces is presented for the developed process. Based on a developed testbed, experimental studies were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the presented process on digital material fabrication.                                         Findings               The proposed two‐channel system can reduce the separation force of a cured layer by an order of magnitude in the bottom‐up projection system. The developed two‐stage cleaning approach can effectively remove resin residue on built surfaces. Several multi‐material designs have been fabricated to highlight the capability of the developed MIP‐SL process.                                         Research limitations/implications               A proof‐of‐concept testbed has been developed. Its building speed and accuracy can be further improved. The tests were limited to the same type of liquid resins. In addition, the removal of trapped air is a challenge in the presented process.                                         Originality/value               This paper presents a novel and a pioneering approach towards digital material fabrication based on the stereolithography process. This research contributes to the additive manufacturing development by significantly expanding the selection of base materials in fabricating solid objects with desired material characteristics.},
